![Main Menu](logo.png)

## Introduction
Pycante is the world’s hottest programming language, taking inspiration from the functional capabilities of Javascript and blending in the spacing of Python to bring the user the most intuitive, pleasing experience. Boasting dictionary capabilities, and both static typing and scoping, Pycante is the future of learnable, readable, and reusable code.

## Features
* .pyc file extension
* Type inference: uses what to find out the type of a variable for example, what(TYPE)
* Static typing
* Static scoping
* Strong typing
* Space matching
* Assignment is handled using “let”
* List Ranges? Comprehensions?
* String Interpolation?
* For loop, while loop, if statement
* Composition and object orientation.
* Dictionaries and object. (Dr. Toal advice)
* Tuples vs Lists. 
## Operators
* Additive: +
* Subtraction: -
* Multiplication: *
* Exponential: **
* Relational: <, >, >=, <=, ==, !=
* Boolean: &, |
* Floor: //
* Modulo: %
* Increment/Decrement: a++, a--
* Warning: 🔥
* Function: 🌶️

## Data Types:
* Number: 4, 27.3, -13.0182
* Boolean: true, false
* String: “Spicy” , “Un poco picante”, “\“What does a nosy pepper do?\”\n\“It gets Jalepeño business!\”
* Comments: ~ Single Line Comment; |- Multi line comment -|

## Examples
Variable declaration.

```
let x = 12

let y = 10

let z = 0 
```


Function declarations

```
🌶️ add(x, y)
    let z = x + y
    return z
```

ٍStrings

```
let str = "Hello"
```


Expressions

```
let addition = 10 + 20 

let multiplication = 10 * 12

```

Conditional statement: if

```
let x = 10
let y = 20 
if (x < 20)
    ~Do something

```

Conditional statement: if else

```
let x = 10
let y = 20 
if (x < 20)
    ~Do something
 else 
    ~ Do something else.
    
```

Iteration. for loop


```
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4]

for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++ )
        ~Do something. 
```


Iteration. while


```
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4]

let index = 0
while (index < 4)
        ~Do something. 
```

Printing. console.hot()

```
let x = 10 

console.hot(x)
   10
let string = "hello"

console.hot(string)
    hello

~ This is an error

let number

console.hot(number)
    🔥: 'number' is not initialized.  

```

Type Inference. what() function is used to infer the type of something.

```
let x = 10 

what(x)
    number

let str = "Hello"

what(str)
    string

let isTrue = true

what(isTrue)
    boolean

let something

what(something)
    🔥: 'something' does not have a type
```

Example of Pycante Dictionaries

```
webster = "aardvark": 1,
    "acapella": 27,
    "pycante": 469,
    "spice": 763.
```

Example of Pycante Classes

```
♨️ Pepper:
    🌶️ f(self)
        return 'spice is nice'
```
