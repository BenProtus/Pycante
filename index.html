      <p class="lead">Pycante is the worldâ€™s hottest programming language, taking inspiration from the functional
        capabilities of Javascript and blending in the spacing of Python to bring the user
        the most intuitive, pleasing experience. Boasting dictionary capabilities,
        and both static typing and scoping, Pycante is the future of learnable,
        readable, and reusable code.</p>

    <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
    <blockquote>Across platforms, maps demonstrate a number of common characteristics in their appearance. Maps are presented with custom annotations, highlighted regions, and overlays. Users have full control to pan, rotate, zoom, and can explore maps in 3D and 2D. One can change the map settings from map, transit, and satellite. The maps also give users a sense of direction, where users can view their current location or can guide them to their next destination using directions APIs.</blockquote>
